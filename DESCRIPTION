Description: This is package performs nonparametric regression or estimation of conditional mean functions by the method of sieves. The method is suitable for problems with multivariate or moderate high-dimensional features. The main estimator in this package, penalized sieve estimator, is adaptive to the feature dimension with provable theoretical guarantees. Moreover, such a method is computationally tractable in the sense it typically has a polynomial dependence (rather than an exponential one) on the feature dimension.
